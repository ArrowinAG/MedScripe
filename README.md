Medscripe is a smart Android app that helps you stay on top of your health by automatically transcribing prescriptions from images and providing personalized medication precautions. Simply upload a picture of your prescription, and Medscripe takes care of the rest – offering you easy-to-understand details about your medication and safety tips.

What is Medscripe?
Medscripe is designed to make managing your medications easier and safer. It uses advanced image recognition technology to read prescriptions, extract vital information like medication names, dosages, and instructions, and then offers tailored precautions to ensure you're using your medication correctly.

With Medscripe, you no longer have to manually decipher hard-to-read prescriptions or search for medication details online. Everything is done in a few taps.

How It Works
Upload a Prescription Image: Take a picture of your prescription and upload it to the app.
Prescription Transcription: The app uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to read and extract all the relevant details like the medicine name, dosage, and any other important info written on the prescription.
Precautionary Suggestions: After transcribing the prescription, Medscripe uses machine learning models to analyze the data and offer customized safety tips and precautions to help you take your medication properly.
Technologies Behind Medscripe
Android SDK
The Medscripe app is built using Android’s SDK to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience. Whether you're using a phone or tablet, the app works seamlessly to process your prescription images and display the results.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
CNNs are at the core of the image recognition process. When you upload a picture of your prescription, CNNs help the app recognize key features and patterns in the image. This allows the app to identify the text on the prescription, even if the handwriting or print is a little hard to read. In simple terms, CNNs help Medscripe "see" and "understand" the content of the image.

Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)
Once the app extracts text from the image, it still needs to make sense of it. That's where LSTMs come in. These neural networks are great for handling sequences of data, like sentences or lists. In Medscripe, LSTMs help understand the context of the transcribed prescription, ensuring that the app correctly identifies the dosage, medicine names, and other instructions. It’s like giving the app the ability to "read" the prescription as a human would, understanding not just the words but their relationships to each other.

TensorFlow
TensorFlow is the engine behind Medscripe’s machine learning models. It’s an open-source framework that makes it easier to train and deploy models like CNNs and LSTMs. By using TensorFlow, Medscripe can quickly process prescription images, extract information accurately, and provide meaningful recommendations in real-time. Essentially, TensorFlow enables the app to learn from data and improve over time, making it smarter with each use.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
OCR is the technology that allows Medscripe to read text from images. Whether the text is handwritten or printed, OCR libraries like Google Vision API or Tesseract help the app convert the text in the image into readable data. In this app, OCR acts as the first step in turning your prescription image into useful information.
