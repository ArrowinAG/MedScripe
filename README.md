# Medscripe

Medscripe is a smart Android app that helps you manage your health by transcribing prescriptions from images and providing personalized medication precautions. Upload a picture of your prescription, and Medscripe offers details about your medication and safety tips.

## What is Medscripe?

Medscripe makes managing your medications easier and safer. It uses advanced image recognition technology to read prescriptions, extract vital information like medication names, dosages, and instructions, and then offers tailored precautions to ensure you're using your medication correctly.

## How It Works

1. **Upload a Prescription Image:** Take a picture of your prescription and upload it to the app.
2. **Prescription Transcription:** The app uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to read and extract all the relevant details like the medicine name, dosage, and any other important info written on the prescription.
3. **Precautionary Suggestions:** After transcribing the prescription, Medscripe uses machine learning models to analyze the data and offer customized safety tips and precautions to help you take your medication properly.

## Technologies Behind Medscripe

### Android SDK

Built using Android’s SDK to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs help the app recognize key features and patterns in the prescription image, allowing it to identify the text even if the handwriting or print is hard to read.

### Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)

LSTMs help understand the context of the transcribed prescription, ensuring the app correctly identifies the dosage, medicine names, and other instructions.

### TensorFlow

TensorFlow powers Medscripe’s machine learning models, enabling quick and accurate processing of prescription images and providing meaningful recommendations in real-time.

### Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

OCR technology allows Medscripe to read text from images, converting the text in the image into readable data.
